Description

The Eat-Da-Burger app allows the user to add the names of burgers they want to eat by typing in the input field the name of the burger and clicking the submit button. Once the burger has been added to the menu, the user can choose to devour the burger by clicking the "Devour" button next to it. This will then cause the burger to move to the "Devoured Burgers" section underneath the menu on the homepage.
